## History
Discalimer: the only thing I know about computer science is that there is more I don't know compared to what I do know. But for what I do know, I enjoy sharing that with someone who doesn't know and would love to know.

My brother is studying computer science at uni; to help him build out his resume/portfolio, I designed this project for him. Instead of building a guideline with clearly outlined goals and expectations, it was just a series of Figma mockups. Looking back, there are many things that I debate about changing, the most obvious being a detailed project outline. With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of a project outline allwoed my brother to expand and explore more areas unexplored by his university courses - API's, XSS, Authentication/Authorization, best practices, and more. The second thing I would change is providing more oversight and review, filling in gaps in workflow and other important best practices when it comes to collaboration.
